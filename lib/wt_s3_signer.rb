# An accelerated version of the reference implementation ported
# from Python, see here:
#
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4-signed-request-examples.html
#
# The optimisation in comparison to the ref implementation
# is that everything that can be computed once gets computed for the
# first signature being generated, and then reused. This includes
# the timestamp and everything derived from it, the signing key
# and the query string (before the signature is computed).
#
# Note that this is specifically made for the cases where one needs
# presigned URLs for multiple objects from the same bucket, with the same
# expiry. Passing the expiry via the constructor, for instance, allows us
# to cache more of the query string - saving even more time.
