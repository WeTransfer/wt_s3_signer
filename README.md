# wt_s3_signer

An optimized AWS S3 URL signer.

## Basic usage

```ruby
s3_bucket = Aws::S3::Bucket.new('shiny-bucket-name')
ttl_seconds = 7 * 24 * 60 * 60

signer = WT::S3Signer.for_s3_bucket(s3_bucket, expires_in: ttl_seconds)
url_str = signer.presigned_get_url(object_key: full_s3_key)
      #=> https://shiny-bucket-name.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dir/testobject?X-Amz-Algorithm...
```

## Why would you want to use it?

The use case is when you need to rapidly generate *lots* of presigned URLs to the same S3 bucket. When
doing the signing, the AWS SDK works fine - but the following operations need to be performed:

* Credential refresh
* Bucket region discovery (in which region does the bucket reside?)
* Bucket endpoint discovery (which hostname should be used for the request?)
* Cleanup of the various edge cases (blacklisted signed headers and so on)

The metadata should be retrieved only once if the bucket does not change, but with the standard
SDK this information might get refreshed often. And there is a substantial amount of generic
code that gets called throughout the SDK call even though it is not strictly necessary.

Our signer bypasses these operations and it performs the credential discovery, as well as bucket
metadata discovery, but *only once* - when you instantiate it. The primary usage pattern is as follows:

```ruby
signer = WT::S3Signer.for_bucket(my_bucket_resource)
signed_urls = all_object_keys.map do |obj_key|
  signer.presigned_get_url(object_key: obj_key)
end
```

This will stay performant even if `signed_urls` contains tens of thousands of entries.

Additionally, we cache all the produced strings very aggressively if they do not change between
calls to the signing method. We also derive the signing key only once. This optimizes the signing even more.

Here are some benchmarks we have made for comparison. The `S3Signer_SDK` class executed the same
flow, but it reused the [Aws::S3::Presigner](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/S3/Presigner.html)
object that it would instantiate only once, and then call repeatedly.
